            Agnisamooh.com is the an global gaming community aspiring to grow with members of diverse castes,
            genders, sexualities, faiths and cultures
            all around the world. We hope to have a curated source for gamers of minority communities as well as
            anyone to have a promotional place to showcase their culture to the world.

            <br>
            We invite passionate game developers and enthusiasts to join us in building a platform where creativity and
            collaboration thrive. Agni is Sanskrit (अग्नि) for Fire, and Samooh is Sanskrit (समूह) for Group.
            Together they spell AgniSamooh in Sanskrit (अग्निसमूह) translated to FireGroup in English.
            <br>
            <br>
            Sanskrit is an ancient language said to be well developed for programming code, and this community brings ancient wisdom to new age
            gamers. The word represents the collective community of game developers all around the world to have
            a universal space open to the community. We aim to bring about Gaming as an hobby to areas of the
            world in strife to bring about peacefull hobbies in harsh environments. We believe there are new
            ideas for worlds, stories and games that people globally havn't experienced from unique cultures
            and perspectives. Thus AgniSamooh was born.
